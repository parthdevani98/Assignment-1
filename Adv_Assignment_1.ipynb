    "The process for creating a class instance in Python involves the following steps:\n",

    "1) Class Definition: First, you need to define the class using the class keyword. The class serves as a blueprint or template      for creating instances. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the instances will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Instantiation: To create an instance of a class, you call the class as if it were a function. This process is called            instantiation. By calling the class, you create a new instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Memory Allocation: When the class is called, Python allocates memory for the instance and initializes it. This involves          creating a unique namespace for the instance and assigning it a reference to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) __init__ Method: If the class has an __init__ method, it is automatically called during instantiation. This method              initializes the attributes of the instance and prepares it for use. The __init__ method can take arguments to customize the      initialization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Instance Object: Once the instantiation and initialization are complete, you have an instance object. The instance has access    to all the attributes and methods defined in the class. You can access and modify its attributes and invoke its methods."

    "\n",
    "2) Class Attributes: Within the class definition, you can define class-level attributes. These attributes are shared by all        instances of the class and are accessed using the class name. Class attributes are typically defined outside of any method      within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Constructor (__init__ method): If you want to specify the initial state of the instance or perform any setup operations, you   can define a constructor method called __init__. This method is automatically called when an instance of the class is created   and allows you to initialize instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Instance Methods: Inside the class definition, you can define instance methods. These methods are functions that operate on      the instance and have access to the instance's attributes. Instance methods are typically defined using the self parameter as    the first argument, which represents the instance itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Class Methods (optional): In addition to instance methods, you can define class methods using the @classmethod decorator.        Class methods receive the class itself as the first argument (cls) instead of the instance.\n",

These         methods do not receive the instance or class as the first argument and are typically used for utility functions that don't       depend on the instance or class state."
